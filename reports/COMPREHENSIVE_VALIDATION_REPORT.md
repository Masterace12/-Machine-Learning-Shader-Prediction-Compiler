## ðŸŸ¡ Issues Identified & Recommendations

### 1. Critical Threading Issues ðŸ”´
**Problem**: `RuntimeError: can't start new thread` affecting ML predictors  
**Impact**: Enhanced ML predictor initialization fails, performance tests timeout  
**Root Cause**: Excessive thread creation (25 threads detected, limit is 8 for Steam Deck)  

**Recommendations**:
- Implement thread pool reuse instead of creating new threads
- Add thread lifecycle management with proper cleanup
- Reduce concurrent thread spawning in ML predictor initialization
- Add resource-aware thread limiting based on Steam Deck constraints

### 2. ML Prediction System Issues ðŸŸ¡
**Problem**: Numba JIT compilation errors in ML predictors  
**Impact**: Some prediction methods fail with typing errors  
**Root Cause**: Numba decorator conflicts with class methods  

**Recommendations**:
- Remove problematic `@jit` decorators from class methods
- Use function-level JIT compilation instead of method-level
- Implement fallback prediction paths when JIT compilation fails
- Add Numba error handling and graceful degradation

### 3. Performance Optimization Timeouts ðŸŸ¡
**Problem**: Performance benchmark tests timeout after 2 minutes  
**Impact**: Cannot validate 280K+ predictions/second target  
**Root Cause**: Resource contention and threading issues  

**Recommendations**:
- Implement lighter-weight performance tests
- Add timeout handling and partial result reporting
- Use async/await patterns instead of thread pools for I/O-bound operations
- Add performance test categories (quick, normal, extensive)
