## 🎯 What This Program Does

The **ML Shader Prediction Compiler** is an intelligent system that **eliminates shader compilation stutters** in games by predicting and pre-compiling shaders before they're needed. It uses machine learning to learn from your gaming patterns and proactively optimize shader caches, resulting in smoother gameplay and faster game loading times.

### The Problem It Solves

When you play games on Steam Deck, you've probably experienced:
- **Sudden frame drops** when new visual effects appear
- **Micro-stutters** during gameplay transitions
- **Long loading screens** when starting games
- **Inconsistent performance** in demanding scenes

These issues occur because games compile shaders (graphics rendering instructions) on-demand, causing temporary performance drops.

### How It Works

1. **🔍 Monitors** your gaming patterns and shader usage
2. **🧠 Predicts** which shaders will be needed next using machine learning
3. **⚡ Pre-compiles** shaders during low-activity moments
4. **🌡️ Manages** thermal conditions to prevent overheating
5. **📊 Optimizes** cache storage for maximum efficiency

## 🔄 Updating

The update script automatically detects your installation and updates if needed:

```bash
./update.sh  # Auto-checks and updates if a new version is available
```

### Update Behavior
- **Automatic detection**: Finds your existing installation (checks multiple locations including `~/.local/share/shader-predict-compile` and `~/.local/shader-predict-compile`)
- **Version checking**: Compares current vs latest GitHub release
- **Smart updates**: Only updates if a newer version is available
- **Backup creation**: Automatically backs up before updating
- **Service management**: Stops/restarts services during update
- **Configuration preservation**: Keeps your settings intact

### Update Options
```bash
./update.sh --help        # Show all available options

# Common options:
./update.sh --no-auto     # Prompt before updating (disable auto-update)
./update.sh --force       # Force reinstall even if up-to-date
./update.sh --dry-run     # Test update process without making changes
./update.sh --skip-backup # Skip backup creation (not recommended)
./update.sh --verbose     # Show detailed update progress
```

### Rollback to Previous Version
If an update causes issues, you can rollback:
```bash
./update.sh --rollback    # Restore the previous version from backup
```

### Update Examples
```bash
# Standard update (recommended)
./update.sh

# Check what would be updated without making changes
./update.sh --dry-run

# Force a complete reinstallation
./update.sh --force

# Update with manual confirmation
./update.sh --no-auto

# Update with detailed output for troubleshooting
./update.sh --verbose
```

### Automatic Backups
- Backups are stored in: `~/.local/share/shader-predict-compile_backups/`
- The 3 most recent backups are kept automatically
- Each backup includes installation files and configuration
