# Steam Deck System Optimization for Enhanced ML Shader Predictor

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive system-level optimizations implemented for the Enhanced ML Shader Predictor, specifically tailored for Steam Deck gaming performance. These optimizations ensure that shader prediction runs transparently in the background without impacting gaming performance.

## Key Features

### 1. **Steam Deck Hardware Detection**
- Automatic detection of Steam Deck hardware (Jupiter/Steam Deck product names)
- APU model identification (Van Gogh for LCD, Phoenix for OLED)
- Hardware-specific thermal thresholds and optimization parameters

### 2. **CPU Resource Management**
- **Core Allocation**: Background tasks use cores 0-1, gaming reserves cores 2-3
- **Process Priority**: Dynamic priority adjustment (background: 19, gaming: 0)
- **CPU Affinity**: Automatic CPU core binding for optimal performance
- **Scheduling Policy**: SCHED_BATCH for background, SCHED_NORMAL for gaming

### 3. **Thermal Management**
- **Real-time Thermal Monitoring**: Direct thermal zone reading from `/sys/class/thermal`
- **Adaptive Throttling**: Prediction adjustments based on thermal state
  - Cool (<65°C LCD / <70°C OLED): 95% baseline performance
  - Normal: 100% baseline performance  
  - Warm: 110% slower predictions
  - Hot: 125% slower predictions
- **Thermal-aware Task Scheduling**: Reduced concurrency during thermal stress

### 4. **Memory Management**
- **Memory Pressure Monitoring**: Real-time RSS tracking and pressure calculation
- **Optimized Buffer Allocation**: Pooled buffers for small/medium/large allocations
- **Garbage Collection**: Smart GC triggering at 80% memory usage
- **Memory Limits**: 512MB limit on Steam Deck, 1GB on desktop systems

### 5. **Gaming Activity Detection**
- **Process Pattern Recognition**: Detects Steam, Proton, Wine, emulators
- **CPU Usage Analysis**: Identifies high-CPU non-system processes as games
- **Dynamic System Mode**: Automatic switching between gaming and background modes

### 6. **Power Management**
- **Battery State Monitoring**: Real-time battery level and power source detection
- **Power-aware Optimization**: Reduced performance on low battery
- **Critical Battery Protection**: Throttling at <10% battery

### 7. **Advanced Task Scheduling**
- **Gaming-aware Scheduler**: Prioritized task queues with gaming detection
- **Thermal-aware Executor**: Task throttling based on thermal state
- **Adaptive Intervals**: 0.1s background, 0.5s gaming, 1.0s thermal throttling

## Usage Examples

### Basic Initialization
```python
from enhanced_ml_predictor import EnhancedMLPredictor

# Initialize with system optimizations
predictor = EnhancedMLPredictor(
    max_memory_mb=40,  # Steam Deck optimized
    enable_async=True
)
```

### Gaming Session Optimization
```python
# Optimize for specific game
predictor.optimize_for_gaming_session("cyberpunk2077")

# System automatically:
# - Switches to gaming mode
# - Performs memory cleanup
# - Warms game-specific cache
# - Schedules background optimizations
```

### System Performance Monitoring
```python
# Get comprehensive system report
report = predictor.get_system_performance_report()

print(f"System Health: {report['system_health']}")
print(f"Steam Deck: {report['is_steam_deck']}")
print(f"APU Model: {report['apu_model']}")
print(f"Thermal State: {report['current_thermal_state']}")
print(f"Memory Pressure: {report['average_memory_pressure']:.1%}")
print(f"Gaming Active: {report['gaming_activity_ratio']:.1%}")
```

### Resource-Aware Predictions
```python
# Predictions automatically adapt to system state
prediction = predictor.predict_compilation_time(
    features=shader_features,
    use_cache=True,
    game_context="cyberpunk2077"
)

# System automatically:
# - Checks thermal state and adjusts prediction
# - Uses optimized memory allocation
# - Performs cache cleanup if needed
# - Throttles if gaming detected
```
